# Go Walker MCP Server Project

This is a Go MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that recursively walks directories and returns file lists.

## Project Structure
- `main.go` - Main MCP server implementation
- `go.mod` - Go module dependencies
- `Makefile` - Build and run commands
- `SPECS.md` - Original project specifications

## MCP Server
- Exposes a `walk_directory` tool that recursively lists files
- Uses SSE transport on port 8124
- Endpoint: http://localhost:8124/mcp
- Converts all path separators to "/" regardless of OS

## Development
- Use `make build` to build the server
- Use `make run` to start the server
- Server will walk the directory it's launched from
