# TAO-1.md: MCP Directory Walker Server Implementation Log

## Implementation Process Documentation

### Step 1
#### Thought
I need to start by reading and understanding the SPEC-1.md file to comprehend all requirements for building the MCP Directory Walker Server. This will help me understand the scope, architecture, and technical specifications before proceeding with implementation.

#### Action
Tool: Read, File: /home/neal/dev/filez-mcp/specs/SPEC-1.md

#### Observation
Successfully read the specification. Key requirements identified:
- Build MCP server in Go with HTTP transport
- Single file implementation (main.go)
- Tool name: walk_directory
- Recursively walk directory structure from command-line specified root
- Path normalization to use '/' separator
- JSON output format with full absolute paths
- Command line interface: ./directory-walker <root_directory>
- Need Makefile with build, run, clean, test targets
- Error handling for permissions and invalid paths

### Step 2
#### Thought
I need to research the current project structure and check if there are existing Go modules or dependencies already set up. This will help me understand what's already in place and what needs to be created.

#### Action
Tool: LS, Path: /home/neal/dev/filez-mcp

#### Observation
Current project structure shows:
- CLAUDE.md (exists, contains project principles)
- specs/ directory with SPEC-1.md
- No go.mod, go.sum, main.go, or Makefile yet
- This is a fresh project that needs full bootstrap

### Step 3
#### Thought
I should check if there are any existing Go files or modules in the project to understand the current state before proceeding with implementation.

#### Action
Tool: Glob, Pattern: **/*.go

#### Observation
No Go files found in the project. This confirms we're starting from scratch and need to create all the Go implementation files as specified.

### Step 4
#### Thought
Before implementing, I need to research available Go MCP libraries to understand the import paths and API structure. I'll search for Go MCP implementations to understand the correct library to use.

#### Action
Tool: WebSearch, Query: golang MCP model context protocol server library github

#### Observation
Found several Go MCP library options:
1. Official SDK: github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk (unstable, release planned for August 2025)
2. mark3labs/mcp-go: Full-featured community implementation
3. metoro-io/mcp-golang: Type-safe implementation with custom transports
4. ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp: Another SDK implementation
5. viant/mcp: JSON-RPC based implementation

For this project, I'll use metoro-io/mcp-golang due to its type safety, HTTP transport support, and low boilerplate approach.

### Step 5
#### Thought
Now I need to verify the current project structure and check for any existing Go modules. The project appears fresh, so I'll need to initialize everything from scratch.

#### Action
Tool: LS, Path: /home/neal/dev/filez-mcp and Tool: Glob, Pattern: go.*

#### Observation
Confirmed project structure:
- CLAUDE.md (project principles)
- specs/ directory with SPEC-1.md and TAO-1.md
- No go.mod, go.sum, main.go, or Makefile files exist
- Starting from completely fresh Go project

### Step 6
#### Thought
I need to initialize a Go module first, then create the main.go implementation. Let me start by creating the go.mod file and then implement the MCP server according to the specification.

#### Action
Tool: Write, File: go.mod (creating Go module)

#### Observation
Successfully created go.mod with module name "filez-mcp", Go version 1.23, and dependency on github.com/metoro-io/mcp-golang v0.16.0

### Step 7
#### Thought
Now I need to implement the main.go file with the MCP server functionality. Based on my research, I'll use the metoro-io/mcp-golang library with Gin HTTP transport to create the server with the walk_directory tool.

#### Action
Tool: Write, File: main.go (implementing MCP server with directory walking functionality)

#### Observation
Successfully created main.go with:
- WalkDirectoryArgs struct for tool input
- WalkDirectoryResult struct for response format
- DirectoryWalkerServer struct to hold root directory
- WalkDirectory method implementing file system traversal
- HTTP MCP server setup with Gin transport
- Command line argument validation
- Path normalization using filepath.ToSlash

### Step 8
#### Thought
I need to create the Makefile with build, run, clean, and test targets as specified in the requirements.

#### Action
Tool: Write, File: Makefile (creating build automation)

#### Observation
Successfully created Makefile with:
- build target: compiles to ./directory-walker
- run target: builds and runs with current directory
- clean target: removes binaries
- test target: runs go test
- deps target: manages dependencies
- fmt and lint targets: code quality

### Step 9
#### Thought
I need to create a CLI test script in the scripts/ directory as required by the project principles for testing functionality from command line.

#### Action
Tool: Bash, Command: mkdir -p scripts and Tool: Write, File: scripts/test-cli.sh

#### Observation
Successfully created scripts directory and test-cli.sh with:
- Executable permissions set
- Tests for current directory usage
- Tests for specific directory usage  
- Tests for invalid directory handling
- Tests for no arguments handling
- All tests designed to verify server startup and error handling

### Step 10
#### Thought
I need to test the build process and fix any compilation errors. Let me run go mod tidy first to get dependencies, then attempt to build.

#### Action
Tool: Bash, Command: go mod tidy

#### Observation
Dependencies downloaded successfully but there were API compatibility issues. The mcp-golang library required Go 1.23.4+ and the import paths didn't match my initial assumptions.

### Step 11
#### Thought
I need to research the correct API usage for the mcp-golang library since my initial implementation had incorrect import paths and method calls.

#### Action
Tool: WebFetch, URL: GitHub documentation and examples for metoro-io/mcp-golang

#### Observation
Found that the correct pattern uses:
- Gin router with HTTP transport
- mcp.NewServer(transport) for server creation
- RegisterTool method for tool registration
- mcp.NewToolResponse with mcp.NewTextContent for responses
- HTTP transport requires Gin framework integration

### Step 12
#### Thought
I need to update main.go with the correct API usage based on the research. This involves updating imports, server creation, and response handling.

#### Action
Tool: Edit, File: main.go (multiple edits to fix API usage)

#### Observation
Successfully updated main.go with:
- Correct import paths including gin-gonic/gin
- Proper Gin router setup with MCP transport
- Fixed tool response creation using mcp.NewToolResponse
- Corrected server initialization and tool registration
- Fixed syntax errors in string formatting

### Step 13
#### Thought
Now I should test the build process to ensure everything compiles correctly.

#### Action
Tool: Bash, Command: make build

#### Observation
Build successful! Created ./directory-walker executable without errors. All dependencies resolved correctly and code compiles cleanly.

### Step 14
#### Thought
I need to run the CLI test script to verify the implementation works as expected and handles various input scenarios correctly.

#### Action
Tool: Bash, Command: ./scripts/test-cli.sh

#### Observation
All CLI tests passed successfully:
- ✓ Server starts with current directory
- ✓ Server starts with specific directory
- ✓ Correctly fails with invalid directory
- ✓ Correctly fails with no arguments
- Server properly displays startup logs and endpoint information

### Step 15
#### Thought
I need to create a comprehensive README.md file to document the project setup, usage, and functionality as required by the project principles.

#### Action
Tool: Write, File: README.md (comprehensive project documentation)

#### Observation
Successfully created README.md with:
- Project overview and features
- Installation and build instructions
- Usage examples and CLI interface
- MCP tool documentation with schema
- Development commands and testing
- Project structure and dependencies
- Error handling and cross-platform notes
