# TAO-1: MCP Directory Walker Server Implementation

## Implementation Log for SPEC-1.md

### Step 1
#### Thought
I need to start implementing the MCP Directory Walker Server as specified in SPEC-1.md. The first step is to research the MCP library and understand the requirements. The spec requires using github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go library, supporting both HTTP and stdio transport, and implementing a single walk_directory tool. I need to initialize the Go module and set up the project structure.

#### Action
Tool: Web Search - Researched MCP (Model Context Protocol) and mark3labs/mcp-go library
Tool: List Directory - Examined current project structure
Tool: Write File - Creating TAO-1.md documentation file

#### Observation
Research shows that while I couldn't find specific documentation for the mark3labs/mcp-go library in my searches, the SPEC-1.md is very detailed about the requirements. The project currently has only REQUIREMENTS.md, specs/, and test/ directories. I need to proceed with implementation based on the detailed specification provided, which includes the tool schema, CLI interface, and technical requirements.

### Step 2
#### Thought
I've successfully added the MCP library dependency and explored its API using `go doc`. The library provides `NewMCPServer`, `ServeStdio`, `NewSSEServer`, and `NewStreamableHTTPServer` functions. I can see the pattern: create an MCPServer, register tools, and then serve it via either stdio or HTTP. The ToolHandlerFunc type signature shows how to handle tool calls. Now I need to create the main.go implementation.

#### Action
Tool: Run Terminal - Added github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go dependency (v0.38.0)
Tool: Run Terminal - Explored the MCP library API using go doc
File: Created explore.go (temporary) to test imports

#### Observation
Successfully added the MCP library. The API structure is clear:
- `NewMCPServer(name, version string, opts...)` creates a server
- `ServeStdio()` for stdio transport
- `NewSSEServer()` or `NewStreamableHTTPServer()` for HTTP transport  
- `ToolHandlerFunc` for implementing tool handlers
- `ServerTool` struct for defining tools
Go version was automatically upgraded to 1.23 to meet library requirements.

### Step 3
#### Thought
Now I need to implement the main.go file with the MCP server and walk_directory tool. Based on the API exploration, I need to use `NewMCPServer`, `AddTools` to register the tool, and either `ServeStdio` or `NewStreamableHTTPServer` for transport. The tool handler should use `ToolHandlerFunc` signature and return `*mcp.CallToolResult`. I need to handle argument parsing using `request.BindArguments()` and return structured content.

#### Action
Tool: Write File - Created main.go with complete MCP server implementation
Tool: Multiple Search/Replace - Fixed compilation errors by using correct API methods
Files Modified: main.go

#### Observation
Successfully implemented main.go with:
- Command-line argument parsing for root directory and -s flag
- MCP server creation using NewMCPServer("directory-walker", "1.0.0")
- walk_directory tool registration with proper schema
- Dual transport support (HTTP via StreamableHTTPServer and stdio via ServeStdio)
- Security checks to prevent directory traversal
- Error handling for permission denied and invalid paths
- Structured content response using NewToolResultStructured()
Fixed compilation errors related to argument parsing, tool registration, and HTTP server methods.

### Step 4
#### Thought
I need comprehensive unit tests to validate the walk_directory tool functionality. The tests should cover default paths, specific paths, nonexistent paths, security checks, and invalid JSON. I'll create a temporary directory structure for testing and verify the tool returns correct file listings with proper path normalization.

#### Action
Tool: Write File - Created main_test.go with comprehensive unit tests
Tool: Delete File - Removed conflicting explore.go file
Tool: Run Terminal - Executed tests successfully

#### Observation
Created comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Root path walking with default "/" parameter
- Subdirectory path walking with "/subdir" parameter  
- Default path behavior when no arguments provided
- Error handling for nonexistent paths
- Security validation for paths outside root directory
- Invalid JSON argument handling
All 6 tests pass successfully, validating core functionality.

### Step 5
#### Thought
According to SPEC-1.md, I need to create two testing tools in the test/ directory: test-stdio.go and test-http.go. These should be command-line tools that can test the MCP server via both transport methods. They need to implement proper MCP protocol communication including initialize, initialized notification, list_tools, and call_tool requests.

#### Action
Tool: Write File - Created test/test-stdio.go for testing stdio transport
Tool: Write File - Created test/test-http.go for testing HTTP transport

#### Observation
Created comprehensive testing tools:
- test-stdio.go: Tests stdio transport by spawning the binary and communicating via stdin/stdout
- test-http.go: Tests HTTP transport by sending HTTP POST requests to the server
Both tools implement full MCP protocol flow: initialize → initialized → list_tools → call_tool with various parameters
Tools include error handling and verbose output for debugging.

### Step 6
#### Thought
The specification requires a Makefile with build, run, test, and clean targets. I need to create a comprehensive build system that handles building the main binary, test tools, running the server in both modes, executing tests, and cleaning up artifacts. I should also include helpful development targets.

#### Action
Tool: Write File - Created Makefile with all required targets and additional development helpers
Tool: Run Terminal - Tested build target successfully
Tool: Run Terminal - Verified binary works with proper usage output

#### Observation
Created comprehensive Makefile with:
- build: Compiles main binary to directory-walker
- run: Builds and runs HTTP server for current directory
- run-stdio: Builds and runs stdio server for current directory
- test: Runs unit tests
- test-integration: Runs integration tests with test tools
- clean: Removes build artifacts
- Additional targets: build-test-tools, test-stdio, test-http, deps, help, fmt, lint
Successfully tested build process and binary execution.

### Step 7
#### Thought
I need to create a comprehensive README.md file that documents setup, usage, API reference, development procedures, and project structure. This should serve as the primary documentation for users and developers, covering all aspects from installation to testing.

#### Action
Tool: Write File - Created comprehensive README.md with full documentation

#### Observation
Created detailed README.md covering:
- Project overview and features
- Installation and build instructions
- Usage examples for both HTTP and stdio transport
- Complete tool reference with schema and examples
- Development guide with build system documentation
- Testing procedures for unit and integration tests
- Project structure overview
- Technical implementation details
- Dependencies and requirements
README provides complete guidance for users and developers.
